      You arrive just before planting. The air is dry and hot, and farmers are already gathering in the shade. One of the farmers spots you, and comes running over.

    <p>
      <q>Aminou! Thank goodness you're here. We've heard about your big study across the three countries. Everyone says you now have real evidence. So tell me - what variety should I plant?</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      You pause. Across Ilam, Regin, and Anikrub, thousands of plots were studied. Farmers tried two varieties: ICRI and Locale.
    </p>

    <p>
      You have the data and so you sit down with them to give them some advice. What do you say?

      The farmer nods slowly. <q>That makes sense. It's what many of us have been noticing.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      You feel relieved -- and slightly humbled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across the entire dataset, ICRI may look stronger on average. But when you break the data down by region, Anikrub tells a different story.

      Overall averages can mislead and the best decision can depend on context.

      Let's walk through this carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Step 1:</alert> Look at overall average yield by variety. You may find that ICRI looks better overall.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Step 2:</alert> Now break the data down by region. When you look at Anikrub specifically, Local outperforms ICRI on average.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>What happened?</alert>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an example of how aggregated data can hide regional differences. The distribution of varieties across regions affects the overall average.
    </p>

    <p>
      Never give advice based only on overall averages when context matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Anikrub, the correct answer is: <alert>Locale</alert>

      Let's walk through this carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Step 1:</alert> Look at overall average yield by variety. You may find that Locale looks better overall.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Step 2:</alert> Now break the data down by region. When you look at Ilam specifically, ICRI outperforms Locale on average.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>What happened?</alert>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an example of how aggregated data can hide regional differences. The distribution of varieties across regions affects the overall average.
    </p>

    <p>
      Never give advice based only on overall averages when context matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Ilam, the correct answer is: <alert>ICRI</alert>

      You pause.
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>Regin.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      The farmer narrows his eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      You feel that small tightening in your stomach.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a larger dataset, you had thousands of farmers across all three countries. Patterns would be clearer – even if misleading at first glance.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this time, you're working with several hundred farmers. Carefully sampled. Balanced. Manageable.
    </p>

    <p>
      But not enormous.
    </p>

    <p>
      You pull out your notebook again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across the dataset, the overall difference between ICRI and Local is<ellipsis/> small.
    </p>

    <p>
      Very small.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you look at the yields by region, the pattern seems to shift slightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      But is that shift real?
    </p>

    <p>
      Or is it noise?
    </p>

    <p>
      You stare at the numbers. Does knowing this farmer is from Anikrub change your answer?
    </p>

    <p>
      The farmer waits.

      <q>Well<ellipsis/> it sure is lovely weather here in Anikrub today.</q>

      The farmer laughs.

        Start by comparing average yield by variety.

    <p>
      Let's walk through this carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Step 1:</alert> Look at overall average yield by variety. You may find that ICRI looks better overall.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Step 2:</alert> Now break the data down by region. When you look at Anikrub specifically, Local outperforms ICRI on average.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>What happened?</alert>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an example of how aggregated data can hide regional differences. The distribution of varieties across regions affects the overall average.
    </p>

    <p>
      Never give advice based only on overall averages when context matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Anikrub, the correct answer is: <alert>Locale</alert>
