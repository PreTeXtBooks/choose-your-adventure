        <title>Not Quite Right</title>
        
        <p>
          You calculated <m>16</m> incidents per day, but let's check your work.
        </p>

        <p>
          The mean (average) is calculated by adding all values and dividing by 
          the number of values:
          <me>
            \text{Mean} = \frac{12 + 15 + 18 + 14 + 22 + 25 + 20}{7}
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's add these up: <m>12 + 15 + 18 + 14 + 22 + 25 + 20 = 126</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          Then divide by 7: <m>126 \div 7 = 18</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          The correct answer is <m>18</m> incidents per day. Perhaps you made 
          an arithmetic error in your addition or division.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that you understand, continue to <xref ref="section-correct-18"/> 
          to proceed with your investigation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="section-correct-18">
        <title>Excellent Work!</title>
        
        <p>
          <alert>Correct!</alert> You calculated the mean as <m>18</m> incidents 
          per day. Well done!
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's verify: The sum of all incidents is <m>12 + 15 + 18 + 14 + 22 + 25 + 20 = 126</m>, 
          and <m>126 \div 7 = 18</m> incidents per day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your client is impressed with your quick analysis. Now they want to 
          dig deeper. They ask: <q>What's the median number of incidents? And 
          how does it compare to the mean?</q>

          You calculated <m>20</m> incidents per day. Let's work through this together.
        </p>

        <p>
          To find the mean, we need to:
          <ol>
            <li><p>Add all the values together</p></li>
            <li><p>Divide by the number of values (7 days)</p></li>

          Sum: <m>12 + 15 + 18 + 14 + 22 + 25 + 20 = 126</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          Mean: <m>126 \div 7 = 18</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          The correct mean is <m>18</m> incidents per day, not <m>20</m>. 
          Perhaps you looked at Sunday's value (<m>20</m>) instead of calculating 
          the average?

            <p>
              The mean of a dataset is calculated by adding all values together 
              and dividing by the number of values:
              <me>
                \bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \cdots + x_n}{n}

          </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>
          For our crime data, we have 7 days, so <m>n = 7</m>. Add all the

          You found <m>15</m> as the median. Let's review the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          To find the median, first arrange the values in order:
          <me>12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25</me>

        <p>
          With 7 values (an odd number), the median is the middle value - 
          the 4th value in the ordered list.
        </p>

        <p>
          Counting from the left: 12 (1st), 14 (2nd), 15 (3rd), <alert>18 (4th)</alert>, 
          20 (5th), 22 (6th), 25 (7th).
        </p>

        <p>
          The median is <m>18</m>. The value <m>15</m> is the 3rd value, not the middle.

          Interesting observation: In this dataset, the mean and median are both

          You found <m>20</m> as the median. Let's verify this.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, arrange all values in ascending order:
          <me>12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25</me>
        </p>

        <p>
          For an odd number of values (we have 7), the median is the middle value. 
          Count to find the 4th value (since <m>(7+1)/2 = 4</m>).
        </p>

        <p>
          The 4th value is <m>18</m>, not <m>20</m>. The value <m>20</m> is 
          actually the 5th value in the ordered list.
