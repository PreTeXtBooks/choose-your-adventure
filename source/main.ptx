      <title>The Beginning of Your Journey</title>
      
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Your adventure in data and statistics begins here. Each decision 
          you make will shape your understanding of statistical concepts.

        <title>The Consultant's Call</title>
        
        <p>
          You are Aminou, a researcher in statistics.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you are not the kind of statistician who hides behind a laptop or speaks only in equations. You know that data begins with people, so you work on the ground with farmers. You sit under mango trees during long afternoon meetings, drinking small (but very strong) cups of tea and listening carefully. You occasionally argue (politely) with government officials in offices where the air hums with ceiling fans and policy ambition.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the past few years, you have been working with small groups of millet farmers in one region. Together, you tested different innovations: alternative weeding methods that reduced labour time, adjustments to planting densities to make better use of limited rainfall, and soil-based fertility treatments inspired by local practices. Some ideas came from research papers. Others came from farmers themselves - practices they had been experimenting with quietly for years.
          <alert>[TODO: Insert real West African RMS example here.]</alert>
        </p>

        <p>
          You didn't just <q>apply</q> research. You co-designed it. You began with their questions:
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Why does this field yield less than that one?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Why does this method work for my neighbour but not for me?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          You listened first. You adapted. You revised your plans when they explained that nothing could be changed during harvest season, or that labour shortages made certain methods unrealistic. You learned that good design is as much about timing and trust as it is about treatments and controls.
        </p>

        <p>
          The results were promising. Yields improved across the region. Labour requirements dropped. Farmers became curious - not because of spreadsheets or graphs, but because they saw the differences with their own eyes. For them, evidence was what grew in their fields.
        </p>

        <p>
          And now, things are changing.
        </p>

        <p>
          What began as a local collaboration is becoming something bigger. Officials in neighbouring regions have heard about your work. NGOs have cited your small trials in reports. Ministries are asking whether these innovations should be promoted nationally.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are being asked to scale up across three neighbouring countries: Ilam, Regin, and Anikrub.
        </p>

        <p>
          All three grow millet as a staple crop. Their soils are broadly similar, and their climate zones overlap - but they are not the same country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ilam has longer dry spells.
          Regin has strong farmer cooperatives.
          Anikrub has more direct government involvement in agriculture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Culturally, politically, and socially, they differ. Their attitudes toward innovation differ. Their labour practices differ. The way decisions are made differs. You know immediately that whatever worked in one place will not simply copy and paste into another.
        </p>

        <p>
          Government ministries, NGOs, and farmer groups are watching. Everyone wants evidence.
        </p>

        <p>
          So today, you sit again under your mango tree, sipping your especially strong tea, turning the problem over in your mind. A proposal deadline is approaching.
        </p>

        <p>
          You need to decide: <alert>Should you begin with a pilot study, or go straight into a main study?</alert>
        </p>

        <p>
          And you know the data will not be simple.
          Even within a single region, farmers and their farms differ. Some have sandy soils that drain quickly; others have clay soils that hold water.
          Even within the same country, soil type can quietly change what <q>works.</q> Farmers themselves differ too. Some are women. Some are men.
          You have seen before that access to labour, tools, and decision-making power can influence outcomes in subtle but important ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then there are the plots:
          Each farmer has six plots. Six small experiments, side by side, exposed to the same weather — but not always the same management.
          On each plot, farmers can decide:
          <ul>
            <li><p>Which millet variety to plant (ICRI or Local)</p></li>
            <li><p>Whether to use zai pits for water harvesting</p></li>
            <li><p>Which weeding method to apply</p></li>
          </ul>
          They might plant one variety on all six plots.
          Or split three and three.
          They might use zai pits on four plots but not the other two.
          They might test a new weeding method on only half their land.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of the season, what you measure is simple: Yield.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you already know something important. Yield is never just about one thing.
          It is shaped by region, farmer characteristics, soil type, plot differences, and the three treatments: variety, zai, and weeding method. And sometimes by things you didn't even measure.
          Some of these factors you can influence, and some you cannot control at all. But if you ignore them, they may quietly distort your results.
          You take another sip of tea.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suddenly the question of <q>pilot or not?</q> feels heavier.
          Because the more variation there is, the more carefully you must design the study to account for it.
          Now the choice is not just about speed - it is about complexity, and learning, and credibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you choose a pilot study, you will start small and can test your data collection tools. You will see how farmers actually distribute variety, zai, and weeding across their six plots, and can
          discover where enumerators misunderstand questions. You can refine your design before committing to a larger, more expensive main study.
          It will take more time, but you will learn before you scale.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you choose to go straight into the main study, you will move quickly. The governments are eager. The ministries want answers.
          You can collect large amounts of data immediately and produce results faster.
          But you will be committing fully to a design that has not yet been tested at scale.
        </p>

        <p><alert>TODO: Something here on pilot studies / podcast with Roger on it / RMS story? </alert></p>

        <p>
          You finish your tea.
        </p>

        <p>
          The decision will shape everything that follows.
        </p>

     <section xml:id="section-not-pilot">
       <title>Main Study</title>
        <p>You chose to go straight into the main study. You have done plenty of similar studies before, so you are ready to dig into the main study now. 
           You finalise the design, draft sampling frames, identify enumerators. It's coming along nicely.
        </p>
        <p>
           Two days later, your phone rings. It's a number you recognise - a regional data collection partner. They're experienced, reputable, and well connected.
        </p>
        <p><q>Aminou! We heard you're launching a multi-country agricultural study. Exciting work.</q>
        </p>
        <p>You smile. <q>Yes. It's ambitious.</q></p>
        <p><q>We can help,</q> they continue.
          <q>In fact, we can do more than help. With our enumerator network, we can cover ten times the number of farmers you’re currently planning and still stay within your budget.</q>
        </p>
        <p>You pause. <q>Ten times?</q></p>
        <p><q>Yes. We already have trained teams in place. Digital data capture, regional supervisors - we've done this before. If governments want strong evidence, scale matters.</q></p>
        <p>You stare at your notebook: Ten times the farmers! Ten times the plots and the data. This is a huge opportunity - impossible to ignore.</p>
        <p>Your partner continues: <q>If you go small, policymakers may question representativeness. But if you go large - really large - the conclusions become harder to dismiss.</q></p>
        <p>You feel the appeal. You haven't piloted this design, or even tested it at scale. But is this too big of an opportunity to miss? But, once you go large, you cannot quietly adjust mid-season.</p>
        <p>Your partner waits. <q>So,</q> they say, <q>shall we scale this properly?</q></p>
        <p>You look out at the mango tree. What do you choose?</p>
        <p>
          <alert>What do you choose?</alert>
          <ul>
            <li><p><xref ref="section-big-q1">Accept the partner's offer and scale up with 10 times the data</xref></p></li>
            <li><p><xref ref="section-medium-q1">Keep the main study at your original planned scale</xref></p></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="section-big-q1">
        <title>Accepting the offer</title>
        <p>You don't hesitate. <q>If we’re going to do this,</q> you say, <q>let's do it properly.</q></p>
        <p>You accept the partner's offer - this will not be a modest study, but instead a national effort — across Ilam, Regin, and Anikrub. The scale is ambitious, but the results could carry real weight.
           You sit down and redraft the proposal: You plan to recruit 240,000 farmers, if each farmer manages 6 plots then you will get 1,440,000 plot-level observations. 
           The number looks almost unreal on the page.
           Surely this will capture the variation - across regions, soil types, farmer characteristics, practices. With numbers this large, patterns should become clear.
          Within the countries, you stratify your sample: By soil type (sandy vs clay) and by farmer gender - you want to make sure you capture variation that you already know matters.
          This is not purely random sampling, but has more structure in it. 
        </p>
        <p>You work with national agricultural ministries to obtain lists of registered farmers. From these lists, farmers will be randomly sampled across districts and regions to ensure geographic coverage.
           On paper, it looks beautiful: Random sampling, national scope, huge statistical power.
           But then you begin thinking operationally. With this many farmers, you will need hundreds, perhaps thousands, of enumerators.
           They will need to be recruited, trained, supervised, and coordinated across three countries with different languages, different administrative systems, and different agricultural rhythms.
           Quality control becomes everything.
           You know from experience that large surveys often sacrifice depth for breadth. With so many farmers to visit, interviews will be brief.
           Conversations will be structured. Data collection risks becoming mechanical - a checklist rather than a dialogue.
           But the upside is enormous.
           If you can pull this off, your findings will be nationally representative. Policymakers will be able to say, confidently if these results reflect the farmers.
           That kind of credibility can influence national agricultural policy. It can shift subsidy decisions. It can affect extension messaging.
           The funding agency approves the proposal, the enumerators are trained, the study rolls out across Ilam, Regin, and Anikrub.
         </p>
         <p><alert>TODO: Insert podcast with David on enumerators?</alert></p>
         <p>
           Months pass and the data rolls in - thousands of rows at a time. Hundreds of thousands. Over a million plot records!
         </p>
         <p>
           Finally, the collection ends. You open the dataset, and it is vast, but very exciting. Surely the answers are in here.

        <title>Medium Survey</title>
        
        <p>
          You decide not to take the leap into massive scale, <q>Thank you for the offer, but, I am happy with the current scale</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          This study will aim to balance statistical power with logistical control. Broad enough to detect patterns. Small enough to manage properly.
          You open your notebook and begin sketching the design. You will work with approximately 24,000 farmers - 8,000 in each country.
          With six plots per farmer, that gives you 144,000 plot-level observations. This is substantial, but not as overwhelming as 10x the amount would be. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You focus on key millet-producing regions within each country — areas where the innovations are relevant and where agricultural systems are comparable.
          Within these regions, you stratify your sample: By soil type (sandy vs clay) and by farmer gender - you want to make sure you capture variation that you already know matters.
          This is not purely random sampling, but has more structure in it. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          Because you have fewer farmers than the large-scale option, you can invest more in enumerator training.
          Your team will be smaller, and supervision will be tighter - but you can monitor consistency across countries more carefully.
          Interviews can be structured, but not rushed, with time for clarification and checking.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposal is approved: Enumerators are trained and data collection begins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Months pass, and data flows in — steady, manageable, substantial.
        </p>
        <p>You sit down and open the dataset: 144,000 plot records. Large enough to reveal patterns. You finally have your data, this is great.

        <title>Pilot Study Path</title>
        
        <p>You chose to begin with a pilot study. 
           You lean back under the mango tree and let yourself breathe. You are not committing to scale yet. You are committing to learning.
           <q>This,</q> you tell yourself, <q>is where we find the cracks before they become faults.</q>
           You design the pilot to be large enough to reveal problems - but small enough to adapt quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          You plan out your pilot: You will work with approximately 240 farmers, 80 from each country. With six plots per farmer, that gives you 1440 plot-level observations.
          Not enormous, but not trivial either - this study is about understanding the structure of the data before you lock it in.
          Within the countries, you stratify your sample: By soil type (sandy vs clay) and by farmer gender - you want to make sure you capture variation that you already know matters.
          This is not purely random sampling, but has more structure in it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You choose communities where you already have trust, or where trusted partners can introduce you properly.
          Within those communities, you work with farmer groups to identify participants who are genuinely interested in experimenting, and you explain to them clearly:
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>This is a learning phase. We are testing the design — not just the treatments.</q>
        </p>
        <p> You refine the questionnaire, test how enumerators record plot-level decisions, to check whether farmers actually distribute variety, zai, and weeding across their six plots the way you expect.
          You also notice a few things. Enumerators occasionally confuse plot numbering, and some farmers describe plots by landmarks rather than sequence.
          Yield measurements vary slightly depending on who weighs the harvest.
          None of this is catastrophic, but it is all useful information for a later main study. 
          You adjust your training materials, clarify your plot definitions, improve the recording template - the pilot is doing exactly what it should:
          It is revealing the study you thought you had designed, and the study that actually exists.
        </p>
        <p><alert>TODO: Is this run over two years. How to account for that in the story.</alter></p>
        <p>
          Months pass, the seasons end, and the pilot dataset is complete.
          You sit down with your 1,440 observations - this is not the final answer, but it is the first honest look at your design.
          You can look at what the pilot data tells you.
