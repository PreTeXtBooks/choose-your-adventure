      <title>The Beginning of Your Journey</title>
      
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Your adventure in data and statistics begins here. Each decision 
          you make will shape your understanding of statistical concepts.

        <title>The Consultant's Call</title>
        
        <p>
          You are Aminou, a researcher in statistics.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you are not the kind of statistician who hides behind a laptop or speaks only in equations. You know that data begins with people, so you work on the ground with farmers. You sit under mango trees during long afternoon meetings, drinking small (but very strong) cups of tea and listening carefully. You occasionally argue (politely) with government officials in offices where the air hums with ceiling fans and policy ambition.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the past few years, you have been working with small groups of millet farmers in one region. Together, you tested different innovations: alternative weeding methods that reduced labour time, adjustments to planting densities to make better use of limited rainfall, and soil-based fertility treatments inspired by local practices. Some ideas came from research papers. Others came from farmers themselves - practices they had been experimenting with quietly for years.
          <alert>[TODO: Insert real West African RMS example here.]</alert>
        </p>

        <p>
          You didn't just <q>apply</q> research. You co-designed it. You began with their questions:
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Why does this field yield less than that one?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Why does this method work for my neighbour but not for me?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          You listened first. You adapted. You revised your plans when they explained that nothing could be changed during harvest season, or that labour shortages made certain methods unrealistic. You learned that good design is as much about timing and trust as it is about treatments and controls.
        </p>

        <p>
          The results were promising. Yields improved across the region. Labour requirements dropped. Farmers became curious - not because of spreadsheets or graphs, but because they saw the differences with their own eyes. For them, evidence was what grew in their fields.
        </p>

        <p>
          And now, things are changing.
        </p>

        <p>
          What began as a local collaboration is becoming something bigger. Officials in neighbouring regions have heard about your work. NGOs have cited your small trials in reports. Ministries are asking whether these innovations should be promoted nationally.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are being asked to scale up across three neighbouring countries: Ilam, Regin, and Anikrub.
        </p>

        <p>
          All three grow millet as a staple crop. Their soils are broadly similar, and their climate zones overlap - but they are not the same country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ilam has longer dry spells.
          Regin has strong farmer cooperatives.
          Anikrub has more direct government involvement in agriculture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Culturally, politically, and socially, they differ. Their attitudes toward innovation differ. Their labour practices differ. The way decisions are made differs. You know immediately that whatever worked in one place will not simply copy and paste into another.
        </p>

        <p>
          Government ministries, NGOs, and farmer groups are watching. Everyone wants evidence.
        </p>

        <p>
          So today, you sit again under your mango tree, sipping your especially strong tea, turning the problem over in your mind. A proposal deadline is approaching.
        </p>

        <p>
          You need to decide: <alert>How much data should you collect?</alert>
        </p>

        <p>
          And you know the data will not be simple.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even within a single region, farmers and their farms differ. Some have sandy soils that drain quickly; others have clay soils that hold water. Even within the same country, soil type can quietly change what <q>works.</q> Farmers themselves differ too. Some are women. Some are men. You have seen before that access to labour, tools, and decision-making power can influence outcomes in subtle but important ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then there are the plots.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each farmer has six plots. Six small experiments, side by side, exposed to the same weather — but not always the same management.
        </p>

        <p>
          On each plot, farmers can decide:
          <ul>
            <li><p>Which millet variety to plant (ICRI or Local)</p></li>
            <li><p>Whether to use zai pits for water harvesting</p></li>
            <li><p>Which weeding method to apply</p></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          They might plant one variety on all six plots.
          Or split three and three.
          They might use zai pits on four plots but not the other two.
          They might test a new weeding method on only half their land.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of the season, what you measure is simple: Yield.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you already know something important. Yield is never just about one thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is shaped by region, farmer characteristics, soil type, plot differences, and the three treatments: variety, zai, and weeding method. And sometimes by things you didn't even measure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of these factors you can influence, and some you cannot control at all. But if you ignore them, they may quietly distort your results.
        </p>

        <p>
          You take another sip of tea.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suddenly the question of <q>How much data?</q> feels heavier.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because the more variation there is, the more carefully you must design the study to account for it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now the choice is not just about size.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is about complexity.
          About credibility.
          About trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you choose a Big Survey, you will gather data from thousands of farmers across all three countries. The results could be nationally representative and politically persuasive, but the study would be expensive, complex, and harder to manage carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you choose a Medium Survey, you will work with several hundred farmers, carefully sampled across regions. It could offer a balance between depth and breadth, but it may fall into an uncomfortable middle ground. Too small to feel nationally definitive, yet too large to build the deep relationships of a truly participatory study.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you choose a Small Study, you will work intensively with a smaller number of farmers. You will gain rich insight and strong engagement, but your findings may be questioned for lacking representativeness.
        </p>

        <p>
          You finish your tea.
        </p>

        <p>
          The decision will shape everything that follows.
        </p>

        <title>Big Survey - The National Approach</title>
        
        <p>
          You chose the Big Survey.
        </p>

        <p>
          You decide to aim for national representativeness. This means gathering data from thousands of farmers across all three countries: Ilam, Regin, and Anikrub. The scale will be ambitious, but the results could carry real political weight.
        </p>

        <p>
          You open your laptop and begin drafting the proposal.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Sample Size:</alert> You plan to recruit 3,000 farmers — 1,000 in each country. With each farmer managing 6 plots, that means 18,000 observations in total. It feels large enough to capture variation across regions, soil types, and farmer characteristics.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Sampling Strategy:</alert> You will work with national agricultural ministries to obtain lists of registered farmers in each country. From these lists, you will randomly sample farmers across different regions to ensure geographic representation.
        </p>

        <p>
          But as you write, you feel the weight of logistical complexity settling in.
        </p>

        <p>
          With 3,000 farmers, you will need a large team of enumerators — people trained to collect data in the field. They will need to be hired, trained, and supervised. Quality control becomes critical. How do you ensure that data collection is consistent across three countries, each with different languages, cultures, and agricultural systems?
        </p>

        <p>
          You also know that large surveys often sacrifice depth for breadth. With so many farmers to visit, your team will have limited time with each one. Data collection might become mechanical — a checklist to complete rather than a conversation to have.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then there's the cost. You estimate the budget: enumerators, transport, training, data management systems. The numbers climb quickly. Funding agencies will want to see strong justification for this level of investment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, if you can pull it off, the results will be nationally representative. Policymakers will be able to say with confidence: <q>These findings apply to our country as a whole.</q> That kind of credibility could influence national agricultural policy across the region.
        </p>

        <p>
          You pause and consider the trade-offs carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          The proposal is approved. The data collection begins. Months pass. The data flows in. And finally, you have your dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now it's time to put that data to use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Continue to <xref ref="Q1-large">Question 1</xref>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="section-medium-q1">
        <title>Medium Survey - The Balanced Approach</title>
        
        <p>
          You chose the Medium Survey.
        </p>

        <p>
          You decide on a middle path — not as large as a national survey, but broader than your previous small-scale work. This approach aims to balance statistical power with manageable logistics and deeper farmer engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          You sketch out the plan in your notebook.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Sample Size:</alert> You will work with approximately 600 farmers — 200 in each country. With 6 plots per farmer, that gives you 3,600 observations. It's substantial, but still small enough that your team can maintain quality control.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Sampling Strategy:</alert> Rather than sampling nationally, you will focus on specific regions within each country — areas where millet farming is most important and where the innovations you're testing are most relevant. Within these regions, you will stratify your sample by soil type and farmer gender to ensure you capture key sources of variation.
        </p>

        <p>
          This approach feels more manageable. You can hire a smaller team of enumerators — perhaps 10-15 people in total — and you can train them more thoroughly. With fewer farmers to visit, your team can spend more time at each farm, building relationships and ensuring data quality.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you feel a nagging uncertainty.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sample size sits in an uncomfortable middle ground. It's not large enough to claim full national representativeness — critics might argue that your findings don't apply to the whole country. Yet it's also not small enough to justify the deep, participatory approach you used in your earlier work. With 600 farmers, you can't co-design every detail or spend months building trust in each community.
        </p>

        <p>
          You're essentially making a compromise: somewhat representative, somewhat engaged — but neither fully.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, this middle path might be the most pragmatic. It allows you to say something meaningful about regional patterns while keeping costs reasonable. And it still gives you enough flexibility to adapt your methods if needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          You wonder whether "balanced" is the right word — or whether you're simply splitting the difference.
        </p>

        <p>
          The proposal is approved. The data collection begins. Months pass. The data flows in. And finally, you have your dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now it's time to put that data to use.
        </p>

          Continue to <xref ref="Q1-medium">Question 1</xref>.

      <section xml:id="section-small-q1">
        <title>Small Study - The In-Depth Approach</title>
        
        <p>
          You chose the Small Study.
        </p>

        <p>
          You decide to stay close to the approach that has worked for you before: intensive, participatory work with a smaller number of farmers. This isn't about claiming national representativeness. It's about understanding deeply — and doing it right.
        </p>

        <p>
          You pull out your notebook and begin planning.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Sample Size:</alert> You will work with approximately 120 farmers — 40 in each country. With 6 plots per farmer, that gives you 720 observations. It's modest by survey standards, but it's enough to detect meaningful patterns if the effects are real.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Sampling Strategy:</alert> You won't sample randomly from national lists. Instead, you will select specific communities in each country — places where you already have relationships or where local partners can help you build trust. Within these communities, you will work closely with farmer groups to identify participants who are genuinely interested in experimenting with new practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          This approach feels familiar. It allows you to do what you do best: co-design the study with farmers, adapt to local realities, and build the kind of trust that leads to high-quality data.
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll be able to visit each farm multiple times during the season. You'll see the plots yourself. You'll sit down with farmers, listen to their observations, and understand not just <em>what</em> happened, but <em>why</em> they think it happened. That contextual knowledge often matters more than statistical precision alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you know the criticism you'll face.
        </p>

        <p>
          With only 120 farmers, selected purposively rather than randomly, your findings won't be nationally representative. Skeptics will say: <q>This worked in these specific communities, but we can't generalize to the whole country.</q> Policymakers who want definitive answers might dismiss your work as <q>just a pilot study.</q>
        </p>

        <p>
          And yet, you've seen how powerful small, well-designed studies can be. They generate insights that large surveys miss. They identify mechanisms, not just averages. And when farmers see results in their own fields — not in a distant research station — that's when change actually happens.
        </p>

        <p>
          You take another sip of tea, now cool, and feel confident in your choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes, depth matters more than breadth.
        </p>

        <p>
          The proposal is approved. The data collection begins. Months pass. The data flows in. And finally, you have your dataset.
        </p>

          You arrive just before planting. The air is dry and hot, and farmers are already gathering in the shade. One of the farmers spots you, and comes running over.
        </p>

        <p>
          <q>Aminou! Thank goodness you're here. We've heard about your big study across the three countries. Everyone says you now have real evidence. So tell me - what variety should I plant?</q>
        </p>

        <p>
          You pause. Across Ilam, Regin, and Anikrub, thousands of plots were studied. Farmers tried two varieties: ICRI and Locale.

          Let's walk through this carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Step 1:</alert> Look at overall average yield by variety. You may find that ICRI looks better overall.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Step 2:</alert> Now break the data down by region. When you look at Anikrub specifically, Local outperforms ICRI on average.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>What happened?</alert>
          This is an example of how aggregated data can hide regional differences. The distribution of varieties across regions affects the overall average.
        </p>

        <p>
          Never give advice based only on overall averages when context matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          For Anikrub, the correct answer is: <alert>Locale</alert>

          Let's walk through this carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Step 1:</alert> Look at overall average yield by variety. You may find that Locale looks better overall.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Step 2:</alert> Now break the data down by region. When you look at Ilam specifically, ICRI outperforms Locale on average.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>What happened?</alert>
          This is an example of how aggregated data can hide regional differences. The distribution of varieties across regions affects the overall average.
        </p>

        <p>
          Never give advice based only on overall averages when context matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          For Ilam, the correct answer is: <alert>ICRI</alert>

          You arrive just before planting. The air is dry and hot, and farmers are already gathering in the shade. One of the farmers spots you, and comes running over.

        <p>

          You pause. Across Ilam, Regin, and Anikrub, you've been working with a carefully selected group of farmers. Farmers tried two varieties: ICRI and Locale.

        <p>
          But this time, you're working with a smaller group of farmers. Carefully selected. In-depth.
          But not enormous.
        </p>

        <p>
          You pull out your notebook again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Across the small dataset, the overall difference between ICRI and Local is<ellipsis/> small.
          Very small.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you look at Anikrub alone, the pattern seems to shift slightly.
        </p>

        <p>
          But is that shift real?
          Or is it noise?
        </p>

        <p>
          You stare at the numbers. Does knowing this farmer is from Anikrub change your answer?

          The farmer waits.

          Start by comparing average yield by variety.
          Then break it down by region. This should lead you to your answer.

          Let's walk through this carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Step 1:</alert> Look at overall average yield by variety. You may find that ICRI looks better overall.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Step 2:</alert> Now break the data down by region. When you look at Anikrub specifically, Local outperforms ICRI on average.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>What happened?</alert>
          This is an example of how aggregated data can hide regional differences. The distribution of varieties across regions affects the overall average.
        </p>

        <p>
          Never give advice based only on overall averages when context matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          For Anikrub, the correct answer is: <alert>Locale</alert>
        </p>
